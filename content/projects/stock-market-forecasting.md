**Tech:** Python, Keras, CNN, NLP, Time Series

**Project:** Stock Market Forecasting with CNN and News Sentiment Analysis  
Developed and tuned multiple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures in Keras to predict Apple (AAPL) stock prices using historical indicators and news sentiment data.

**Key Achievements**
- Integrated sentiment scores from financial news (Intrino API + VADER NLP) with stock trading features (volume, open, high, low, change in value) for multivariate time-series forecasting.
- Optimized hyperparameters (filters, kernel size, dense units) and trained using Adam optimizer with RMSE as the evaluation metric, achieving ~2 RMSE (â‰ˆ3% error).
- Demonstrated CNN's ability to capture complex temporal patterns, highlighting potential for broader applications in financial forecasting and multivariate time-series prediction.
