It needed to determine its location quickly and efficiently to survive and send rescue signals.\n\n**Approach:** Developed a particle filter that initialized candidate satellite positions, updated their weights based on noisy sensor data, resampled iteratively, and modeled orbital motion with Gaussian noise. Combined localization with planetary phase-angle calculations to determine the correct transmission direction.\n\n**Outcome:** The filter localized the satellite within 0.01 AU accuracy, operated under strict CPU time limits, and successfully enabled reliable SOS message transmission to the home planet.\n\n<div class=\"media-container\">\n  <video controls class=\"media-player\">\n    <source src=\"/resume/Videos_RAIT/Particle Filter.mov\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n    <source src=\"/resume/Videos_RAIT/Particle Filter.mov\" type=\"video/quicktime\" />\n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\n  </video>\n</div>\n",

It needed to localize itself, map obstacles, and reach the treasure while avoiding collisions.\n\n**Approach:** Implemented a SLAM algorithm to estimate both drone and tree positions from noisy distance and bearing measurements. Designed a path-planning strategy that used SLAM outputs to generate safe movement commands within turning and distance constraints, checking potential collisions with lineâ€“circle intersection tests.\n\n**Outcome:** The system achieved accurate localization within 0.25m, successfully mapped obstacles, and navigated the drone to the treasure without collisions, completing the mission efficiently.\n\n<div class=\"media-container\">\n  <video controls class=\"media-player\">\n    <source src=\"/resume/Videos_RAIT/SLAM Video.mov\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n    <source src=\"/resume/Videos_RAIT/SLAM Video.mov\" type=\"video/quicktime\" />\n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\n  </video>\n</div>\n",

Challenges included limited cell access in the deterministic case, additional floor costs in uneven terrains, and uncertain robot movements due to stochastic effects.\n\n**Approach:** Designed efficient search-based algorithms to generate delivery plans under strict viewing constraints. Extended the solution with cost-aware pathfinding (similar to Dijkstra/A*) to handle varying floor costs. For stochastic environments, developed optimal policies that account for motion uncertainty using probability distributions, ensuring reliable pickup and delivery.\n\n**Outcome:** The system produced near-optimal delivery plans with minimal warehouse cell access, adapted to floor cost variations for reduced overall cost, and successfully generated robust stochastic policies that enabled the robot to complete deliveries despite uncertainty.\n\n<div class=\"media-container\">\n  <video controls class=\"media-player\">\n    <source src=\"/resume/Videos_RAIT/Warehouse Astar Search.mov\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n    <source src=\"/resume/Videos_RAIT/Warehouse Astar Search.mov\" type=\"video/quicktime\" />\n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\n  </video>\n</div>\n",
