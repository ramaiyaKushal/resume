I work across backend engineering and machine learning, carefully balancing research and production readiness. My happy place is unpacking ambiguous problems, giving teams clarity, and shipping minimal, maintainable solutions on tight loops.

Currently leaning into LLM tooling, observability, and developer experience. Outside of work you will find me on a badminton court, planning the next road trip, or diving into new music rabbit holes.
